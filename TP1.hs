-- PFL 2024/2025 Practical assignment 1

{-- All code must be properly commented: each function should include
the type declaration (signature) as well a brief description of the functionâ€™s goal and the meaning of the arguments.
--}
{--
The evaluation focuses on
implemented features, the quality and efficiency of the code and respective com
ments, the readme file, and participation in the assignment and presentation.
